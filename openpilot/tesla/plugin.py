"""xpilot plugin interface. Rules for writing a plugin: XPILOT.md at the repo root.

One feature = one package openpilot/tesla/plugins/<id>/, found automatically:
  plugin.json  manifest: id, category, priority, claims, enable switch, settings, params (openpilot/tesla/manifest.py)
  plugin.py    the Plugin subclass named by the manifest's "entry"
  ui.py        optional: Tile, HudOverlay (onroad HUD) and ScreenOverlay subclasses, found by the UI
SP stays the main stack: SP files only call these hooks. Every hook has a do-nothing default.
The host (plugins/__init__.py) builds only enabled plugins that win their claims, refuses unclaimed use,
and drops a plugin at its first exception.
